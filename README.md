# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who set and came close to her fundraising goal of $10,000. The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on crowdfunding data for other campaigns to uncover trends. These trends will be compared to Louise’s campaign to predict possible outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis was performed by first breaking up the data to show the outcomes for all theater crowdfunding campaigns based on launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next the data was filtered to show the outcome of specific campaign types based on goals. By showing the success and failure rate of only plays based on the campaigns goal dollar amount a prediction can be made about Louise’s possibility of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenges I encountered during this project were using new formulas and ensuring all the information was in the correct category when creating a pivot table. Pivot tables can be displayed in so many ways but finding the best way to showcase your data can be challenging. I was able to overcome these challenges by rereading the instructions as well as simple trial and error. 

## Results

Based on the data, the best time to launch a theater campaign would be May or June. Theater campaigns with launch dates in May and June have the highest success rate. Campaigns launched in December have the lowest success rate. 

In addition, plays with the highest success rate were those with a funding goal of less than $1000. These plays saw a success rate of 76% and failure rate of only 24%. Louise’s goal was $10,000 and according to the data, plays with similar goals had a success rate of 54% and failure rate of 46%. 

Although the data provided is useful it is also limited. It would be beneficial to know what type of fundraising medium was used for each play. Did the plays with higher successful rates put on a fundraising event or focus on an online platform? The data is also limited by not showing the playwright along with their experience. This will be Louise’s first play and fundraising campaign. It would not be ideal to use data from well-known playwrights, who already have a core audience and following, to predict the outcome of Louise’s campaign. 

Another useful table would be one showing the outcomes based on the amount of time the campaigns were run using the date created conversion and date ended conversion.
