# Kickstarter-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who set and came close to her fundraising goal of $10,000. The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on crowdfunding data for other campaigns to uncover trends. These trends will be compared to Louise’s campaign to predict possible outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next the data was filtered to show the outcome of specific campaign types based on goals. By showing the success and failure rate of only plays based on the campaigns goal dollar amount a prediction can be made about Louise’s possibility of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
